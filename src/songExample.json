'Cause if so, girl, you a blessing\nDo you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?\nI'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans\nIf I was down, would you say things to make me smile?\nI'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\nAnd when you asked me about it, I said it wasn't me\nWould you believe me or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\nWe only humans, girl, we make mistakes\nTo make it up, I'll do whatever it take\nI love you like a fat kid love cake\nYou know my style, I say anything to make you smile\n\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\n(Girl) could you love me in a Bentley?\nCould you love me on a bus?\nI'll ask twenty-one questions and they all about us\nCould you love me in a Bentley?\nCould you love me on a bus?\nI'll ask twenty-one questions and they all about us"
